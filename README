Nano.js 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does for Javascript what the Nano.php does for PHP.
In other words, it's a bunch of common stuff that makes life easier.

It will obtain a bunch of external libraries, will set up Grunt with Babel
and Uglify-JS, and can generate gruntfiles for projects using the libraries.

Run './get-deps.js' to download external resource scripts.
Run 'npm install' to install grunt dependencies.
Run 'grunt'
