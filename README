Nano.js 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does for Javascript what the Nano.php does for PHP.
In other words, it's a bunch of common stuff that makes life easier.

It will obtain a bunch of external libraries, will set up Grunt with Babel
and Uglify-JS, and can generate gruntfiles for projects using the libraries.

Run 'npm install' to install grunt dependencies.
Run 'grunt download' to download external resource scripts.
Run 'grunt' to compile the source files into website scripts.
Run 'grunt clean:build' to remove intermediate build files.
Run 'grunt clean:release' to remove website scripts.
Run 'grunt clean:deps' to remove external resource scripts.
