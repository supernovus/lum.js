Nano.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does for Javascript what the Nano Framework does for PHP.
In other words, it's a bunch of common stuff that makes life easier.

It uses jQuery where possible, and most of its functionality is provided
as jQuery plugins.

Installation is simple: copy or link everything from "scripts" into your own
"scripts" directory, and type "make".

From then on out, build your javascript files, and compile them easily.

Say you created "mylib.js" and you want to compile it into a smaller file.

Well, you can use jsmin to do so using:

  make mylib.min.js

Or you could use the Google Closure Compiler by using:

  make mylib.cc.js

It's literally that simple.

The Makefile will automatically download jQuery, the JSON library, jsmin
and the Closure Compiler. Easy as pie.

Requirements:

 * make          This is the tool that powers the magic.
 * gcc           Needed for jsmin, along with the standard C libraries.
 * unzip         Needed for Closure Compiler.
 * java          Needed for Closure Compiler.
