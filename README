Nano.js 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does for Javascript what the Nano.php does for PHP.
In other words, it's a bunch of common stuff that makes life easier.

It will obtain a bunch of external libraries, will set up Grunt with Babel
and Uglify-JS, and can generate gruntfiles for projects using the libraries.

Run './bin/get-deps' to download external dependencies.
Run './bin/setup-grunt' to install grunt using 'npm'.
Run './bin/make-gruntfile <output-file>' to generate a gruntfile.
