Nano.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does for Javascript what the Nano.php does for PHP.
In other words, it's a bunch of common stuff that makes life easier.

It uses jQuery where possible, and most of its functionality is provided
as jQuery plugins.

Type "make" by itself to download jsmin, Google Closure Compiler, 
jQuery, JSON3 and Riot.js.

Type "make all" to download the above plus Underscore, LESS, Moment.js,
YepNope and Modernizr.

Type "make minify_all" to make .min.js versions of any uncompiled scripts.

Type "make compile_all" to make .cc.js versions of any uncompiled scripts.

Type "make uglify_all" to make .ug.js versions of any uncompiled scripts.

There are a few other features, check out the Makefile for details.

Requirements:

 * make          This is the tool that powers the magic.
 * gcc           Needed for jsmin, along with the standard C libraries.
 * unzip         Needed for Closure Compiler.
 * java          Needed for Closure Compiler.
 * uglifyjs      Optional, only neeed if you want to generate .ug.js files.
