    <h1>Lum[V5] Test</h1>

    <p>
    Testing must be done via the JS console.
    The <code>global-object</code> compatibility library is available as the
    <code>Lum</code> global variable, and a custom library testing helper is 
    available as the <code>lt</code> global variable.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use <code>lt(...libs)</code> to load any other libraries you might want.
    If you want a full list, <code>lt()</code> will give that to you.
    Omit the directory, and the <code>.js</code> extension, as it's supplied 
    for you.
    </p>

    <p>
    Use <code>lt.lum(...libs)</code> to load more <em>Lum.js</em> libraries,
    which is anything in the <code>scripts/nano</code> folder. 
    Omit the <code>.js</code> file extension, it's supplied for you.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to the main libraries in <code>scripts/nano</code>, there are
    also several external scripts available in <code>scripts/ext</code> that 
    can be loaded using <code>lt.ext(...libs)</code>:
    </p>

    <p>
    <code>clipboard, easel, feature, jquery, jquery-ui, luxon, moment,
    require, sprintf, stacktrace</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <strong>Crypto-JS</strong> libraries can be loaded using 
    <code>lt.cjs(...libs)</code>; if you don't know the exact library, 
    omitting any arguments will load the `crypto-js` bundle which 
    includes every major library in one file.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <strong>ACE Editor</strong> can be loaded using <code>lt.ace()</code>; 
    no arguments needed, as further ACE features are loaded on-demand,
    using an <em>package-local</em> version of RequireJS that won't 
    conflict with the version provided by <code>lt.ext()</code>.
    </p>
